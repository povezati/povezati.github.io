								<h3>Who are we?</h3>
								<p>There are two questions people immediately ask when they talk to us, how do we pronounce your name, and what does it mean? So let's get those two done right off the bat. Povezati (pronounced Po-ve-za) is the croatian form of the verb to connect. Which really when you get down to it is the basis of our mission. We want to connect people to their city and community both online and offline. Now this does not mean make everything digital, but instead using technology that best suits the culture to bring out it's individuality.</p>

								<p>Now how we do that is where things get a bit more interesting. We work alongside city leaders, local and large businesses, developers, and the general community to bring technology in that makes the city more useful for the people in it. It's universally agreed that government's typically "do things" for it's people, but in our digital life there is a growing idea that instead we should co-design for each other. So that our governments act more as a platform or ecosystem where they provide the base infrustructure so residents and businesses can build solutions to the problems that really bother them.</p>

								<h4>What is a smart city?</h4>
								<p>There is the common idea of a smart city: a highly efficient system, fed by sensors and data that promises to ease many of the present and future challenges of urbanization. Smart traffic lights will adjust traffic flows to ease congestion, car-parking pricing will fluctuate dynamically based on demand, and key infrastructure (like autonomous public transport car fleets) will anticipate our movement needs, arriving at our front doors based on information in our web-connected calendars before we even digitally hail a driver.</p>

								<p>But our issue with that is everything is driven by technology and globalization. Now don't get us wrong all of that is wonderful, but eats easy to lose sight of why cities exist in the first place. We created cities as a way for us to connect with each other more easily by being together. So our idea of a smart city focuses more on those connections. Bringing people closer with their city, so that their technological innovations are focused on coming together instead of standing alone.</p>
